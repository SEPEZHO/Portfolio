Portfolio is my second largest project. Back end based on Nodejs, front end powered by React and sass. Every 10 minutes back end request my gitHub about new commits, repositories and etc. He write all in DB (MYSQL). Also he catch and store some info from front. And in the end backend can send mails thrue google smtp. Front end works only with API and touch nothing else. He based on SPA principle, how you can see.

Used: React; Sass; NodeJs; Nginx; MYSQL.

Approximate volumes: 3.7k lines of code.
